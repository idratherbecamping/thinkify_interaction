## Introduction
This Considerations Packet provides basic information for educational professionals currently engaged in or considering improving inclusive practices in a school. Topics include:  
- Conducting a self-assessment to determine the school's starting point for action related to inclusive practices.  
- Following a change model to move from initiating to sustaining inclusive practices.  
- Forming a guiding team to monitor progress.  
- Providing ongoing professional development directly related to educator needs.

## Getting Started
As a school moves toward inclusion, stakeholders should follow a process for change. The following outlines **Kotter's model for change** (1996), adapted from *Creating an Inclusive School Environment: A Model for School Leaders* (The IRIS Center, 2010).

### Figure 1: Kotter's Model for Change

6. Ensure Short-Term Wins  
7. Improve and Expand  
8. Anchor the Changes

## Steps 1–3: Preparing for Change

### 1. Establish a Sense of Urgency
Establishing a sense of urgency is crucial for gaining cooperation (Kotter, 1996). School leaders can:  
- Review current data to identify learning gaps between all students.  
- Disaggregate data by subgroup, including:  
  - Office discipline referrals  
  - Child study findings  
  - Retentions  
  - District-level benchmark and Standards of Learning (SOL) scores  

### 2. Form a Guiding Team
Engage relevant stakeholders who:  
- Support the vision for an inclusive educational environment.  
- Have authority and expertise to make and implement decisions.  
- Have established credibility among colleagues.  
- Have demonstrated leadership in the school (Kotter, 1996).  

Adopt a group process to ensure effective teamwork. For more information, refer to the *T/TAC W&M Considerations Packet: Strategies for Creating Effective School Leadership Teams*.

### 3. Create a Vision Statement
The vision statement should be:  
- **Clear and focused** on the vision and desired outcomes.  
- **Challenging**, future-oriented, and inclusive of outcomes.  
- **Specific, achievable, and realistic**.  
- **Inspiring**, aspirational rather than a checklist.  
- **Measurable**, with identified measures for success.  
- **Subject to refinement**, allowing room for growth.  

The vision creates a picture of the school’s future and motivates educators to achieve it (Kotter, 1996).

## Steps 4–6: Implementing Changes

### 4. Communicate the Vision
Develop a communication plan to gain support from faculty, staff, families, and the community. A shared sense of the desired future motivates and coordinates stakeholders (Kotter, 1996).

### 5. Enable Action
Empower educators by removing implementation barriers (Kotter, 1996). Steps include:  
- Use self-assessment tools to evaluate current inclusiveness and identify strengths and growth opportunities.  
- Establish a baseline and identify priorities for action.  
- Construct an action plan with:  
  - Measurable objectives  
  - Actionable tasks or steps  
  - Data collection methods  
  - Criteria for evaluation  
  - A timeline for achieving objectives  
  - Person(s) responsible for oversight

### 6. Ensure Short-Term Wins
Short-term wins validate efforts and maintain urgency. Focus on goals achievable in 3–6 months to:  
- Test the vision against concrete conditions.  
- Undermine cynics and resisters (Kotter, 1996).

## Steps 7–8: Sustaining Inclusion

### 7. Improve and Expand
Reflect on what is and isn’t working, adjusting the plan as needed. Expand by providing professional learning opportunities tailored to stakeholders’ needs using the **Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM)** (Hall & Hord, 2006).  

#### CBAM Stages of Concern
- **Stage 0: Awareness** – Minimal knowledge of inclusion.  
- **Stage 1: Informational** – General awareness but uninvolved.  
- **Stage 2: Personal** – Recognizing personal impact (e.g., students with disabilities in their classrooms).  
- **Stage 3: Management** – Focus on effective methodologies for teaching exceptional learners.  
- **Stage 4: Consequence** – Attention to student outcomes and accountability.  
- **Stage 5: Collaboration** – Working with colleagues to improve practice.  
- **Stage 6: Refocusing** – Interest in refinement and innovation.  

#### Table 2: Stages of Concern and Staff Development Activities
| **Stage of Concern** | **Staff Development Activity** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Awareness** | Brief overview workshop, awareness-level videos, faculty meeting updates, brief articles on inclusion. |
| **Informational** | Full-day workshops, parent presentations, practitioner presentations, brief professional articles. |
| **Personal** | Group discussions, practitioner presentations with Q&A, conference attendance, reading/discussion groups, visits to inclusive classrooms. |
| **Management** | Practical books/articles, problem-solving sessions, videos of strategies, classroom visits with teacher dialogue, resource investigation. |
| **Consequence** | Research articles on outcomes, colleague discussions, research projects, study groups, video self-analysis. |
| **Collaboration** | Problem-solving meetings, peer coaching, staff meeting updates, curriculum development committees. |
| **Refocusing** | Reading club, peer coaching, conferences, presenting experiences, discussions with advocates, independent study. |

*(Adapted from Beninghof & Singer, 1998)*

### 8. Anchor the Change
Incorporate changes into school documents (e.g., improvement plans, evaluations, handbooks, websites). Cultural change occurs when new approaches prove effective (Kotter, 1996). Outstanding leaders think long-term to sustain inclusion (Kotter, 2012).

## Self-Assessment for Inclusive Practices
Use guiding questions to assess inclusiveness. “Yes” answers indicate evident practices; “No” answers highlight areas for growth. Adapted from a T/TAC W&M tool based on Maryland Coalition for Inclusive Education (2011).

### Table 1: Guiding Questions for Quality Indicators
#### Administrative Support for Inclusion
1. Does the school communicate a vision valuing all learners?  
2. Does the school improvement plan include inclusive practices with action steps?  
3. Is person-first language used and modeled by staff?  
4. Do administrators communicate that general educators are responsible for teaching students with disabilities, supported by special educators?  
5. Does the administrative team create balanced classroom rosters?  
6. Are school-wide supports in place for social skills and relationships?  

#### Collaborative Planning and Teaching Structures
7. Is there adequate, regular planning time for general and special education teachers?  
8. Are varied service delivery models (e.g., co-teaching, UDL, flexible groupings) used?  
9. Do teachers share roles so distinctions between “specialist” and “classroom teacher” are minimized?  
10. Do co-teaching structures align with student needs?  
11. Do teachers provide multiple response opportunities?  
12. Does planning reflect UDL, student readiness, interests, and choice?  
13. Are professional development opportunities provided for UDL strategies?  
14. Are paraprofessionals skilled contributors?  

#### Individual Student Supports
15. Do pre-referral strategies include documented accommodations/modifications?  
16. Is data-based decision-making used for academic/behavioral challenges?  
17. Do students have access to technology supporting learning/communication?  
18. Is there a planning process for transitions to ensure supports are implemented?  
19. Are families regularly consulted about their children’s programs?  
20. Do students with disabilities have access to extracurricular activities?  

#### Individual Education Program (IEP) Development
21. Do students with disabilities receive most education with age-/grade-appropriate peers?  
22. Are supplementary services and accommodations collaboratively implemented?  
23. Are IEP goals aligned with Standards of Learning and focused on key skills?  
24. Do special educators provide consultation/services in general education classrooms?  
25. Are families full members of the IEP team?
