What is

What is
sensory
integration?

Everyone has a sensory system!

Sensory integration and processing refers to the way
the nervous system receives messages from the senses
and turns them into appropriate motor and
behavioral responses. 

Whether you are biting into a sandwich, riding a
bicycle, or reading a book, your successful
completion of the activity requires accurate
processing of sensation.

Everyone processes the sensory world differently. 

Source: sensoryhealth.org/basic/about-spd

There are 8
sensory
systems

You are likely familiar
with the main 5, but there
are 3 hidden senses!

Visual

Auditory

Gustatory
(Taste)

Olfactory  
(Smell)

Tactile
(Touch)

Proprioception 

Interoception

Vestibular

01

Visual
This is your sense of sight - not how well you
see, but how your brain interprets the visual
information in your environment. 


02. Auditory
This is your sense of hearing - not how well
you hear, but how your brain interprets the
auditory information in your environment.


03. Gustatory

This is your sense of taste. 


04. Olfactory

This is your sense of smell.

05

Tactile
This is your sense of touch. You have tactile
receptors all over your body. 


06. Proprioception
This is your sense of movement and body
position. You have receptors in your joints and
muscles that tell your brain where your body is
and what it's doing.


07. Vestibular

This is your sense of movement. Your
vestibular system is located in your inner
ears, therefore whenever your head
moves, you activate your vestibular
system.


08. Interoception
This is your sense of internal processing -
hunger and thirst, needing to use the
bathroom, when you feel sick, etc. 

We all have these 8 senses,
but we all process the sensory
world a little bit differently.

Everyone has their unique sensory quirks. 

But sometimes the signals from the body
and brain get mixed up and sensory
processing challenges may arise.

What happens
if there’s a
sensory traffic
jam?

Now imagine a traffic jam of those messages. They aren’t
being efficiently transmitted, or they’re getting lost or stuck or
just not making sense to the brain. 

When those messages aren’t being efficiently transferred on
the inside, the outside world can look like:
noises that are too loud to process 
movement makes you ill
certain textures create a visceral response

Sensory
Processing
Disorder
(SPD)

Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is a condition that affects
how your brain processes sensory information (stimuli).

Some individuals have mild challenges with processing the
sensory world, some have significant challenges, and some
have what we call ‘sensory quirks’ that are noticeable, but
the individual can still function.

SPD can affect one sense or multiple senses. Children who
have SPD may overreact to sounds, clothing, and food
textures. Or they may underreact to sensory input. This
causes them to crave more intense thrill-seeking stimuli. Also,
children with SPD are not always just one or the other. They
can be a mixture of oversensitive and under-sensitive.

work through their sensory differences.

Some examples of true
sensory processing disorder symptoms:

Unable to tolerate clothing, limited food
preference, self injurious behaviors, or
significant drooling due to tactile processing
challenges.

Severe motion sickness, gravitational
insecurity, w-sitting or low muscle tone, or is
considered on-the-go due to vestibular
processing challenges.

Sensory
Modulation
Disorder
(SMD)

Sensory Modulation refers to a complex process of
perceiving sensory information, followed by an appropriate
adaptive response to the situation.

It describes the ability to regulate and organize reactions to
sensory input, filter out unnecessary sensory stimuli, and focus
on relevant stimuli while maintaining an optimal level of
arousal.

This is a critical component of a human's ability to function
that affects the person's ability to interact with the physical
and human environment, their ability to adapt to daily life
challenges, and their quality of life.

Create a
sensory
diet

A sensory diet is a group of sensory-based activities that help
a person feel cool, calm, and regulated. 

A sensory diet is personalized - everyone is different so every
sensory diet is different. 

Think about the things you do throughout the day to stay
focused - chewing gum, going on a mid-day walk, etc. -
those are all part of your sensory diet! 

You’ve likely learned to do these things without even thinking
about them … subconsciously you know that they help you.

Sensory Diets

Everyone benefits from sensory diets! 

We all participate in sensory diets of our own without thinking about it.

Drinking coffee in the morning
Going for a walk after work
Doodling while listening to a lecture
Chewing gum
Exercising
